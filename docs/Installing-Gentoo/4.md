# Bootloader Configuration
For this chapter of the Handbook, you can solely follow this guide you are reading.

Firstly, we tell portage that we are using a UEFI device:
```shell
echo 'GRUB_PLATFORMS="efi-64"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
```

Then we emerge GRUB:
```shell
emerge --ask sys-boot/grub:2
```

## Check your EFI directory
The efi-directory is where the vfat partition that you created is mounted.

If you are unsure of your EFI directory, then you can do `lsblk`.
```shell
lsblk
```
This lists the disk drives and there mount points, you should see where your first disk is mounted. (`nvem0n1p1`) Use that path for the following grub command.

```shell
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot
```

Finally, we can configure the grub boot loader:
```shell
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Reboot
Now exit the chroot
```shell
exit
```
Unmount the things:
```shell
cd
umount -l /mnt/gentoo/dev{/shm,/pts,}
umount -R /mnt/gentoo
```

Cross your fingers and reboot:
```shell
reboot
```
