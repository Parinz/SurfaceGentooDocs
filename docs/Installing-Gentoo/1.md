# Creating & Booting the Live USB

Gentoo can be installed from a non-gentoo usb. For this reason, I choose to use the **Arch Linux** live iso. Since it has the 5.13 kernel baked in. 

You can download it [here.](https://archlinux.org/download/)

Then just burn the iso with dd:
```shell
dd bs=4M if=path/to/archlinux-version-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdx conv=fsync oflag=direct status=progress
```

## Disabling Secure Boot
1. Turn off your Surface Device.
2. Press and release the power button **_WHILE_** you hold the volume up button (F6 for Surface Laptops).
3. You should see something like this.

4. In here, click on the Security tab. And you'll see the Secure Boot option. If yours is anything other than, _Secure Boot is Disabled_, then you should click "Change Configuration". And click "None".

6. Ensure that, _"Enable Boot from USB devices"_ is on. And drag the _USB Storage_ boot option, to the top.
7. After you've done that, **plug the USB** that you have flashed into the surface. Then, navigate to the _Exit_ tab and click **Restart now**.


## Booting
If you have an **External USB hub**, you can boot normally and skip to the next page.

Otherwise, select **_Copy to Ram_** so you can pull out your USB and plug your laptop fan in.
