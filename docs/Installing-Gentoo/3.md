# Configuring the System & Installing System Tools

For this chapter (Configuring the System) of the handbook, you can safely **ignore** these steps and do the whole chapter:
- _**Configuring the Network**_
- _**Automatically start networking at boot**_
- _**(Optional) Get PCMCIA Working**_

# Installing System Tools

For this chapter (Installing System Tools), you can also go ahead and follow all the steps in it. **However, in this guide we will be using `Network Manager` instead of `dhcpcd` AND `wpa_supplicant`.** As I have found it to be more reliable.

First we want to add the Network Manager *useflag* to our make.conf:
```make.conf
USE="${USE} networkmanager"
```

You should also check [Network Manager useflags](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NetworkManager#USE_flags) to see which one you want to enable and add it.
```make.conf
USE="${USE} networkmanager wifi bluetooth"
```

After changing the useflags run the following command for it to take effect:
```shell
emerge --ask --changed-use --deep @world
```
This should automatically pull in Network Manager. You should also enable OpenRC to start the service.
```shell
rc-update add NetworkManager default
```
If you are using systemd:
```shell
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```
